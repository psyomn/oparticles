OParticles!!
============

This is a case study in OCaml in order to learn the language. I'll be doing 
something simpler in this project; I will be using OpenGL with this language
in order to show some bouncing particles inside a box, with maybe, physics. 

The reason of this is because OCaml is said to be an industrial strength 
language, and graphics + calculations tend to require some sort of performance. 

Let's see how this goes!

Stuff to take into consideration
================================

We want to look out how these aspects are dealt with in OCaml: 

* Concurrency
* String Manipulation (see how easy or not it is to deal with strings)
* Perfomance (Read somewhere that OCaml is supposed to be industrial strength;
therefore I'll be using glcaml in order to demonstrate a n-particle application)
* Software Engineering practices
* Documentation of APIs (trivial, but nice to know)
